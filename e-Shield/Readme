I have obtained 3 shields and several sensors for experimentation by engineering students. There are 4 teams
that have opted for sensor-based app development. One more will be ordered soon. I am waiting for the enginnering student to
talk to nursing students and decide how the topic will be addressed. That will decide which sensors to buy and interface.

Here is the link for the shield: https://www.cooking-hacks.com/documentation/tutorials/ehealth-biometric-sensor-platform-arduino-raspberry-pi-medical

All the four teams are requested to provide in their team repositories any info that they have found out. The intent is to help
other teams. Such teams will get extra credit.

The Four teams are: Groups 1,2, 7, and 11. 

Thanks
Dr. Shankar
