This provides more info on the use of open source version of VistA (WorldVistA) that is used within the VA hospitals for 
electronic records of patients' medical files. This is in collaboration with the non-profit WorldVistA:

Ohm Trivedi, an undergraduate student with good IT and data analytics background will help the teams. At present, a virtual server
is being installed at FAU. He is learning the EWD.js framework which we should be able to use for interfacing VistA or other 
MUMPS databases. MUMPS is perhaps the first noSQL language, ideally suited for medical databases, typically large, but sparse. 
Relational databases would be inefficient. Modern implementations combine the strengths of the two.

As a student, you can take all the 3 courses for a discounted price of $57. I would have to pay, as a faculty member, $225.

The three groups who will use the EMR/IT backbone for their projects are: Groups 4, 5, and 10.
